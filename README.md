# beq
Discord bot, based upon example bot: https://medium.com/@renesansz/tutorial-creating-a-simple-discord-bot-9465a2764dc0

uses node.js and a few others
reads in a local copy of the boQwI' database to offer simple translations

This project also houses the "beq Engine", I've moved the XML read/dictionary lookup into a separate file that is used by the bot.
Another use for the beq Engine will be "ask beq", which needs the same dictionary lookup, but completely different handling otherwise.

Any changes to the beq Engine should be made HERE!
