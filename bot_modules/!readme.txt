Important:

All modules should export a variable named "versInt", containing only the version NUMBER, and a variable named nameInt, containing the name or label, so both can be used (together or alone) to identify the module.

Key word being "should" - I'm not done reworking it all. Ideally, I should find a way to seamlessly integrate other modules...
