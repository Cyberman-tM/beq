Important:

All modules should export a variable named "versInt", containing only the version NUMBER, and a variable named nameInt, containing the name or label, so both can be used (together or alone) to identify the module.

Key word being "should" - I'm not done reworking it all. Ideally, I should find a way to seamlessly integrate other modules...

Also important:
I'm trying to create an open interface that makes it easy to integrate new functions without having to re-add everything every time I make a change on the master.
Key word here being "trying". If you copy the source now (feel free, of course), don't bet on everything being the same.
(Not that any of it is complex enough to be a problem, but still...)
